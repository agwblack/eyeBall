TODO

Medium term goal
----------------
Medium term goal is to create a playground level with interchangeable physics
and entity collision.

Short term goals
----------------
Need to implement different functions for calculating forces (magnetic
repulsion, gravity, air resistance, friction, etc

Abstract them so they can be called from anywhere (namespace Physics).

Make them interchangeable at run time and implement menu options to do so.

Better yet, make changing them part of the game (e.g.collect a blue ball to
switch to magnetism paradigm, collect blue and white to switch to Gilbert model
of magnetism, etc.). This should give opportunities to play with presenting
text to the viewer ("Switching to Magnetism!").
