2D Android Platformer based on Cocos2dx.

TODO
====

Medium term goal
----------------
Medium term goal is to create a playground level with interchangeable physics
and entity collision.

Short term goals
----------------
Add more physics regimes.

Make them interchangeable at run time and implement menu options to do so.

Better yet, make changing them part of the game (e.g.collect a blue ball to
switch to magnetism paradigm, collect blue and white to switch to Gilbert model
of magnetism, etc.). This should give opportunities to play with presenting
text to the viewer ("Switching to Magnetism!").

Add touch injection (propulsion).

Add collision detection.

Add map scrolling (so the map can be bigger than the screen).

Get images (eye, goal, background).

Building
========
This repository contains just the project folder and the Android.mk file which
comprise the core of the game. These can be placed into an existing cocos2dx
file structure. build-native.sh will probably need altering. Tested with 
cocos2d-1.0.1-x0.13.0-beta. The repository contains none of the cocos2dx
source or libraries (available at http://www.cocos2d-x.org).
